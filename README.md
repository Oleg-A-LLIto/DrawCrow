# DrawCrow

Draw Crow is a small web painting program. It lets you create artworks of any size and use multiple layers with various blending modes.

## Your options in case you want to play with it:
1) Just go to https://oleg-a-llito.github.io/DrawCrow/
2) To use it locally, host it on your local HTTP server (I use Apache) and open 127.0.0.1 or localhost in your browser.
